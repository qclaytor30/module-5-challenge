# module-5-challenge

<h1>Work Day Scheduler</h1>
<p>My task for this challenge was to creat a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The application should feature dynamically updated html and css powered by jQuery. </p>
<h2>Criteria</h2>
<p>For this challenge I was given starter code and I used moment.js to work with date and time.</p>
<p>When a user opens the planner, the current date is displayed at the top of the page. Each time slot is color coded to indicate each time slot as either past(gray), present(red), or future(green). When the user clicks the save icon/button, the text or task typed in the event will be saved in local storage and will stay saved after refreshing the page. </p>
